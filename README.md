# Java Game Engine 3
##Note: there is literally no reason anyone should ever use this engine in a reasonable project

This was the 3rd revision of a game engine I made in Java a loooonggggg time ago. It was my first big project and as such is also very (and I do mean VERY) rough.  

Unfortunately that also means I never documented the functions and usage of this engine.  

What I do know are what functionalities this engine does and does not have:  

Does have:
1. Windowing system using GLFW
2. Input system using GLFW
3. Custom Shaders
4. 2d rendering using OpenGL
5. 3d rendering using OpenGL
6. Textures
7. Materials
8. Default renderer for basic 2d rendering and decent 3d rendering
9. Useable asset importing
10. Skeletal animations

Does not have:
1. A physics system
2. A networking system (ignore the "NetworkingTest" in tests)
3. An easy to use interface
4. A good skeletal animation system (The "AnimationTest" is kind of broken)
